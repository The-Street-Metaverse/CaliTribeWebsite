          title: 'What is The Street Metaverse Game?',
          content: 'The Street Metaverse Game is a unity game with blockchain elements. The NFT you minted is tied to the game and becomes your pet. By sending a monster to the Hunt, you will earn $TROPHY utility tokens, which in the future you can exchange and spend in the in-game store for useful items and rare NFT. Parallel to this, you will need to take care of the pet, feed it, raise its level, send it to wild duels and climb the leaderboard. A breeding system will also be introduced in one of the future updates. The bot will be a copy of the browser game for Discord server.'

          title: 'What is a REAL Token',
          content: 'Yes! The economic basis of the game - REAL utility tokens. The Street Metaverse Alter Natives  will be able to receive it. To do this, you will need to send the monster to the Hunt, where he will mine $TROPHY. Hunting is the main mechanic of earning tokens and includes an element of randomness. At the first stage of the game, holders will have the opportunity to collect tokens for the further game. Later they will be able to use them to exchange or purchase various useful items and rare NFT prizes in the in-game store. Who started earlier will be in a better position in the future, you can already accumulate start-up capital while waiting for updates. Beyond the fundamental P2E mechanics, the goal of our development is to create a comfortable environment for you to have a good time, make new friends and get passive profit. This game will delight Tamagotchi fans!'

          title: 'How will donations be made?',
          content: 'After the main sale, when the 100% target is reached, we make a large donation to several worldwide animal-related organizations. The community will choose by voting where exactly to donate the money. But we do not want this to be a one-time promotion, as animals need food and care every day. Therefore, on a monthly basis, we will donate a percentage of secondary sales, also electing organizations by voting among the community.'
